This Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project is a quiz game that tests the user's knowledge on a variety of topics. The game will be written in Java and will feature multiple-choice questions with four possible answers. The user will be able to select an answer and receive feedback on whether they got the question right or wrong. The game will also keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the game. Additionally, the game will have a timer to limit how long the user has to answer each question. Finally, there will be an option for users to save their progress and resume playing at a later time.
